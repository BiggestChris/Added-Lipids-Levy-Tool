    Buttery, Cheesy Garlic Pizza Recipe
    Ingredients:
    Dough:
    3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    1 tsp sugar
    2 tsp salt
    1 packet active dry yeast (2 ¼ tsp)
    1 ¼ cups warm water (110°F)
    2 tbsp olive oil (for dough)
    4 tbsp melted butter (for brushing)
    Garlic Butter Sauce:
    6 tbsp unsalted butter
    3 cloves garlic, finely minced
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 tsp dried oregano
    1 tsp dried basil
    ½ tsp salt
    ¼ tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
    Toppings:
    2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
    ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1 cup ricotta cheese (optional)
    ¼ cup olive oil (for drizzling)
    Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)
    Instructions:
    Step 1: Prepare the Dough
    Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes foamy and bubbles.
    Mix the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Slowly pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil, mixing with a wooden spoon until it starts to form a rough dough.
    Knead the dough: Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead it for 8-10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if it feels too sticky.
    Let the dough rise: Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm area for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.
    Step 2: Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce
    Melt the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add garlic and herbs: Once the butter is melted, add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant (don’t let it brown). Stir in the olive oil, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and red pepper flakes. Let it cook for another 1 minute, then remove it from the heat.
    Step 3: Assemble the Pizza
    Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C), or as high as your oven will go. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
    Shape the dough: Punch down the dough and roll it out onto a floured surface. Shape it into your desired size—12 to 14 inches for a regular-sized pizza, or divide the dough for smaller pizzas. You can stretch it by hand for a more rustic look.
    Prepare the pan: Brush a pizza pan (or baking sheet) generously with melted butter and olive oil, making sure to coat the entire surface to get a crispy, flavorful crust.
    Butter the crust: Transfer the dough to the prepared pan. Brush the entire surface of the dough, especially the edges, with some of the garlic butter sauce, reserving some sauce for later.
    Step 4: Add Toppings
    Cheese and butter layering: Spread a light layer of ricotta cheese (if using) over the dough, then sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly across the pizza. Follow with grated Parmesan.
    Drizzle with more garlic butter: Drizzle the remaining garlic butter sauce over the cheese. This will give the pizza a rich garlic flavor. Add some olive oil drizzles on top for extra richness.
    Step 5: Bake the Pizza
    Bake: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on it towards the end to ensure it doesn’t burn.
    Finishing touches: Once out of the oven, brush the crust with any remaining melted butter for extra flavor and shine. If desired, garnish with fresh basil leaves.
    Step 6: Serve
    Let the pizza cool for a couple of minutes before slicing. This indulgent pizza will have a buttery, garlicky crust with rich layers of cheese, making every bite incredibly flavorful.
    Enjoy your super tasty, buttery, and cheesy pizza!

    Recipe: Buttery, Cheesy Garlic Pizza
    Unnecessary lipids: 4 tbsp melted butter (for brushing), 6 tbsp unsalted butter, 1 tbsp olive oil, ¼ cup olive oil
    Excess calories: Calculating the approximate calories from the unnecessary lipids, we have:
    - 4 tbsp melted butter = 408 calories
    - 6 tbsp unsalted butter = 612 calories
    - 1 tbsp olive oil = 119 calories
    - ¼ cup olive oil = 477 calories
    Total excess calories = 1616 calories

    Levy: Based on the excess calories, the levy would be £6 (1616 calories / 250 = 6.464 -> £7)

    Suggestions: To reduce the unnecessary lipids and calories in this recipe, you could consider using less butter for brushing the dough and reducing the amount of butter and oil in the garlic butter sauce. Additionally, you could opt for lighter cheese options or reduce the amount of cheese used in the toppings. This would help lower the overall calorie content and, consequently, reduce the levy applied.
