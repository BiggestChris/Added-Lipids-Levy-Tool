Recipe:
    Here's a recipe for a delicious, juicy cheeseburger that will hit all the right notes!

    Ingredients:
    For the Burger Patties:

    1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 for juiciness)
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
    1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (optional, but adds great flavor)
    1 tsp garlic powder
    1 tsp onion powder
    For Assembling:

    4 burger buns (brioche buns work great for a rich flavor)
    Butter for toasting the buns
    4 slices of cheddar cheese (or your favorite cheese)
    1 red onion, thinly sliced
    1-2 ripe tomatoes, sliced
    Lettuce leaves (Romaine or Iceberg)
    Pickles (optional)
    Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise for condiments (or your preferred sauces)
    Instructions:
    1. Prepare the Patties:
    Mix the Ground Beef: In a large bowl, combine the ground beef with Worcestershire sauce (if using), garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix gently to avoid overworking the meat (over-mixing can make the patties tough).
    Form the Patties: Divide the meat into 4 equal portions and shape into patties slightly larger than your buns (as they’ll shrink a little during cooking). Press a small dimple in the center of each patty with your thumb. This helps prevent the burgers from puffing up as they cook.
    Season the Patties: Generously season both sides with salt and pepper.
    2. Cooking the Patties:
    Grill or Pan-Fry: Preheat your grill or a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time if you prefer them more or less done.
    Add the Cheese: When you flip the patties, add a slice of cheese on top during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking. Cover the grill or place a lid over the skillet to help melt the cheese.
    3. Toast the Buns:
    Butter the insides of the buns and toast them on the grill or in the skillet for about 1-2 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy.
    4. Assemble the Cheeseburgers:
    Spread your favorite condiments on the bottom bun (ketchup, mustard, mayo, or a combo).
    Layer on the lettuce, tomato slices, and red onion.
    Place the cheesy patty on top of the veggies.
    Add pickles if desired, then place the top bun on the burger.
    5. Serve:
    Serve immediately with fries or your favorite sides, and enjoy the cheeseburger!
    Extra Tips:
    Optional Toppings: Sautéed mushrooms, crispy bacon, avocado, or caramelized onions can take your burger to the next level.
    Rest the Patties: After cooking, let the patties rest for 2-3 minutes before assembling. This helps the juices redistribute and keeps the burger juicy.
    Enjoy your delicious homemade cheeseburger!
